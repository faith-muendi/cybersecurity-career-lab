# Cybersecurity Career Lab
# 🛡️ Wazuh SOC Monitoring & Detection Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates a fully functional Security Operations Center (SOC) lab built using **Wazuh SIEM**.  
It showcases real-world monitoring, log analysis, and detection capabilities integrated with both **Linux and Windows agents**.

The goal of this lab is to simulate enterprise-level SOC operations — detecting, investigating, and responding to simulated cyberattacks mapped to the **MITRE ATT&CK framework**.

---

## 🔍 Key Components
- **Wazuh Manager** running in Docker  
- **Kali Linux Agent** (simulated attacker endpoint)  
- **Windows Agent** (monitored workstation)  
- **Sysmon & Auditd logs** for detailed telemetry  
- **Custom Wazuh rules and decoders** for detection

---

## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated
- SIEM Configuration and Management  
- Threat Detection & Log Correlation  
- Incident Investigation using Alerts  
- Linux and Windows Agent Integration  
- SOC Automation and Evidence Collection

## 📂 Evidence Files
| File | Description |
|------|--------------|
| `manager_ossec_log.txt` | Snapshot of the Wazuh manager’s operational log |
| `manager_alerts.json` | Captured JSON alerts generated by agent activity |

---

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. Wazuh agents (Kali + Windows) forward system and security logs to the Wazuh Manager.  
2. The manager analyzes logs for anomalies, triggers alerts, and stores results in JSON format.  
3. Custom rules are applied to detect failed SSH logins, privilege escalations, and file tampering.  
4. All logs and alerts are stored in the `evidence/` directory for forensic review.

---

## 🧾 Detection Scenarios
- Failed SSH login attempts (Brute-force simulation)  
- File modification detection (Integrity Monitoring)  
- Privilege escalation attempts  
- Command execution monitoring  

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
- Integrate Elastic Stack (Kibana dashboards)  
- Add threat intelligence correlation (VirusTotal API)  
- Automate alert classification with Python scripts
